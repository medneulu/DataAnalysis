# ðŸ§® Sales Data Analysis Project

This is my very first data analysis project using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
The dataset is fictional sales data, and I explored various techniques such as:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Descriptive statistics
- Grouping and filtering
- Creating new columns (e.g., cost, revenue per age)
- Data visualizations (boxplot, histogram, scatter, pie, etc.)
- Basic validation and consistency checks

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains fictional sales records, including:
- Customer age
- Country
- State
- Order quantity
- Unit price and cost
- Revenue and profit

### ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### ðŸš€ Goal
This project helped me practice core data analysis skills and understand how to draw insights from real-world-like datasets.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
Since this is my first data-related project, I focused on exploring the basics and experimenting with different types of visualizations and logic.
