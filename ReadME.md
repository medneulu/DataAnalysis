# 🧠 Data Analysis & Data Science Journey

Welcome to my data analysis and data science learning journey!  
This repository is where I document everything I learn, try, break, fix, and build as I grow from zero to data hero. 🚀

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn the fundamentals of **data analysis** and **data science**
- Practice using tools like **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and others
- Explore datasets, extract insights, and visualize data in meaningful ways
- Track my progress from absolute beginner to confident data practitioner
- Collect all of my small and big projects in one place 📂

## 📦 Project Structure

Each project will live in its own folder under this repository (e.g. `/analysis`, `/visuals`, etc).  
Every folder may include:
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Visuals and plots
- Notes or summaries
- `README.md` with what I did and what I learned
